# Amazon-Clone-Using-HTML-CSS
Amazon Clone using HTML & CSS is a Frontend Design of "amazon.com". In this I tried to make it more eye-appealing.
In this project i have used many concepts of html and css to make it very a unique and Refreshing design. it is also a my first ever project which i have created.
if you wants to use this projects then you should have to include all files in correctly otherwise it gonna messed up.
so,take care while using it for project.
